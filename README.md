# Party Invitations Via Text Message
This is a Python project that helped me invite a list of people to my mom's 50th birthday party using Twilio

## Project Description:
The motivation behind this project is that I was tasked with inviting about 75 people to my mom's surprise 50th birthday party. At first thought, I could just add all phone numbers into my phone and text them the invitations individually, but what happens if there's a change to the party's date, or if the entire group needs to be notified at once? This realization made me take to good ole python.

The basic function of this project is to mass text a list of phone numbers. In my case, I wanted to send a picture of the invitation and an RSVP message along with it. The program does this by referencing a the column of a CSV file to extract the phone numbers and place them into a python list. Then, using the Twilio API, it simply for loops through the list of numbers a sends them each the picture and the message.

For this implementation, I used Python in Google Colab. Python was chosen for its ease of interfacing with various high-level applications, and Google Colab was chosen because you don't have to download, install, or run anything to use it. Additionally, I used Excel to create the CSV file for the phone numbers on the fly. Lastly, I needed a way to
